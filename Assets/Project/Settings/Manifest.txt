Project Final Gift 2026 – Manifesto

Project Final Gift 2026 is a top-down pixel art hack & slash action-adventure mini game that reinterprets the spirit of classic games through a short, focused, and modern experience.

The game takes place within an elementary school campus that appears ordinary on the surface, yet hides dark and unexpected secrets. The player controls Ali, a student who must enter three hidden dungeons scattered across the campus and retrieve three talismans. Each dungeon is built around simple but fluid combat, exploration, and spatial awareness.

Throughout this journey, Ali encounters jelly-like enemies that have emerged from the depths of the school. The tone intentionally balances innocence and threat—childlike spaces contrasted with an underlying sense of danger.

Once all three talismans are collected, the final dungeon at the heart of the campus is unlocked. There, Ali uncovers the truth:
the school principal is the mastermind behind the chaos—the evil jelly boss.

The game reaches its climax with a single boss fight, after which the story concludes.

Project Final Gift 2026 offers a slightly over one hour long gameplay experience, with a clear beginning and end. It avoids unnecessary systems and artificial length, focusing instead on delivering a complete and self-contained adventure reminiscent of classic games.

The project draws inspiration from the SNES-era top-down design philosophy, particularly titles such as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Final Fantasy IV, as well as other games of that period. Its goal is not to build a massive world, but to create a small, meaningful, and cohesive game.

Project Final Gift 2026 is not a nostalgia exercise.
It is a personal and intentional mini adventure, told through the language of the past.
